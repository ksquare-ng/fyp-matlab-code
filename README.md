vectorAMP + MMSE is the function for VAMP\
bomp is the function for BaGOMP\
\
For each script, choose appriopriate algorithm function, P_fa and P_md calculation, and variable parameters\
For the same script, necessary changes for each figure is noted below.\
\
Scenario 1: \
Figure 4 - s_iter (run function vectorAMP)\
Figure 5 - s_iter (run function bomp)\
Figure 6 - hold figure for Figure 4 and 5\
Figure 7 - s_time (run function vector AMP and bomp)\
\
Scenario 2: \
Figure 8 - s_pilot (hold figure, iter = 10 for vectorAMP or iter = 100 for bomp, distance = 100 - 750)\
\
Scenario 3: \
Figure 9 - s_antenna (hold_figure, iter = 10 for vectorAMP or iter = 100 for bomp, distance = 100 - 750, L = 100) \
\
Scenario 4: \
Figure 10 - s_active (hold_figure, iter = 10 for vectorAMP or iter = 100 for bomp, distance = 100 - 750)\
\
Scenario 5: \
Figure 11 - s_antenna (hold figure, iter = 10 for vectorAMP or iter = 100 for bomp, distance = 100 or 750, L = 100)\
Figure 12 - s_antenna (hold figure, iter = 10 for vectorAMP or iter = 100 for bomp, distance = 100 or 750, L = 100 or 300)\
\
Scenario 6: \
Figure 13 - s_block_block (hold figure, iter = 10 for vectorAMP or iter = 100 for bomp)\
Figure 14 - s_pilot_block (hold figure, iter = 10 for vectorAMP or iter = 100 for bomp)\
Figure 15 - s_antenna_block (hold figure, iter = 10 for vectorAMP or iter = 100 for bomp)\
